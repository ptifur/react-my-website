## Practice project

All right here is my first project in React

It doesn't really do much but still it's the first step!

- I figured out the basic file srtucture

- Learned how to import images

- How to `build` the project and deploy it

- Learned to add `rel="noopener noreferrer` with the `target="_blank"` links

### Todo

- Add comic bubble thing

- Try paperclip

- Image on transparent background
