### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Practice project

All right here is my first project in React. (Not following the tutorial, freewheeling)

It doesn't really do much but still it's the first step!

I figured out the basic file srtucture. Learned how to import images.

How to build the project and deploy it. And how to use Netlify CLI as well.
